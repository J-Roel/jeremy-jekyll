description: What is all the Squarespace positive hype about? It's 25 premade websites that allow you to change their font and pictures and add wanna-be plugins that are trying to be widgets. It's junk to any real full-stack developer.

			<h4>Squarespace. A dead end.</h4>
			<hr/>
			<p>Google Squarespace reviews, then Google some YouTube videos.</p>
			<p>And what do you hear? <strong>"It's beautiful, it's wonderful, it's amazing"... it's crap.</strong></p>
			<hr/>
			

			<p>For my full-stack capstone project I made something similar to this. It was a drag and drop interface to prototyping websites. I was basic, but could almost do more than Squarespace. And I don't have the money. Squarespace is sponsering superbowl ads? Maybe they should spend some more money on their service.</p>

			<p>I don't know if it was the dragging and dropping frustration that first turned me off to their software. But by the end of inspecting their own css to find classes so I could over-ride them... What is this nonesense? This isn't web-development, this is hacking someone elses site to look like what you want. That's not even a product, nor do you have enough control to make truly your own website without massive tweaking of classes that could screw up the entire site.</p>

			<p>So I am forced to use this for a client. Which is a great company with a great cause, So I sucked it up, and decided to watch some inspirational videos so I can work with their software.</p>

			<p>They showed how to override the sites css. That is hacking the site, that is not building your own and the gal got all sorts of compliments on how smart and witty she is for... overriding CSS? Are you serious?</p>
			<p>Okay, how to change the a sections background color. Oh, you have to beable to add a section, which you can't do anymore cause all of the docs and answers on squarespace are way outdated and nothing works like it did. You know, I can't even find many people bashing this worthless $16/month waste of money and time. Good marketing Squarespace.</p>
			<p>At this point my conclusion was... Squarespace is NOT for web-developers. It is a shifty half-cocked version of 25 wordpress-ish themes with NO DIRECT ACCESS to rebuilding the theme or adding custom widgets. And I'm sorry friend... but overriding CSS is NOT BUILDING YOUR OWN WEBSITE.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Widgets. So there are a lot of references to how great the widgets are... They are NOT widgets. They are little plugins that companies pay them to use. Some of which are total crap.</p>

			<p>IF you like working with a very frustrating drag and drop and half-assing CSS so it's broke... Enjoy Squarespace!</p>
			<p>If you like being creative and really want to make cool sites... Use WP and learn css, then take some html/css classes online. It will be money well spent, and then you'll see why Squarespace sucks.</p>
