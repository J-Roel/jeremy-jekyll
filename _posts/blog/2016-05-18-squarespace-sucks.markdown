description: What is all the Squarespace positive hype about? It's 25 premade websites that allow you to change their font and pictures and add wanna-be plugins that are trying to be widgets. It's junk to any real full-stack developer.

			<p>Google Squarespace reviews, then Google some YouTube videos.</p>
			<p>And what do you hear? <strong>"It's beautiful, it's wonderful, it's amazing"... it's crap.</strong></p>

			<p>For my full-stack capstone project I made something similar to this. It was a drag and drop interface to prototype websites. I was basic, but could almost do more than Squarespace. And I don't have the money. Squarespace is sponsering superbowl ads? But their software sucks.</p>
