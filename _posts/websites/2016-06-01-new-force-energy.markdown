description: This sales site showcases the rigs of New Force Energy. The rigs are high tech and the most environmentally friendly drilling rigs available in the world. That's saying a lot. Besides the well head itself. They leave no footprint.

		<p>I was really happy to make this site. I have been the company man on these rigs before and knew most of the crew. It was sad to see technology that the PUBLIC WANTED to be swept to the side. Larger companies (Anadarko) leave huge enviornmental damage with every well. Other companies have taken great strides in protecting our environment while extracting these commodities. I wish the public were more informed. The new gas and oil regulations are stamping out small companies that care, and allowing big companies, like Anadarko, to have free reign.</p>
		<p>Hopefully, someone will purchase these gems and help protect the enviornment that we are required to use to survive as we do.</p>
