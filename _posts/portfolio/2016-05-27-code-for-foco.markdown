<p>Code for FoCo is a collaboration with the City of Fort Collins, Galvanize, and local developers to assist in the creation of community and non-profit websites and web applications.</p> <!--more-->

<p>Led by <a href="http://jordanmajd.com/">Jordan Majdolashrafi</a>, we are a group that is not just building websites and applications, but growing an environment of transparency with local government, helping start-ups in need, and teaching people, students and children the fundamentals of programming, art, technology.
