description: Even though I can tackle any programming problem. I enjoy the front-end user experience the most. Being creative, and making functional eye-candy is something I could do every day.

				<h4>HTML, CSS(SASS), and JavaScript. Making it happen.</h4>
			<hr/>
			<p>I began with <a href="/torque-3d-demos/">video games</a>. Then I found web design.</p>
			<p>The video, audio and photography aspect of web design parallel these needs in a game. The interaction you need must envoke the senses as much as possible. You see many mediums attempt to do this, but nothing can compare to a video game. Or can it?</p>
			<p>Web technologies are catching up. We see shaders (filters in CSS) and many advanced rendering engines powering web sites.</p>

			<p>So web design is perfect.</p>
			<p>I graduated from Galvanize of Fort Collins in April of 2016 and I am no longer a mere hobbyist. I am doing what I love for a living.</p>
			<p>Being a confident programmer able to make amazing and complex web applications, has really opened doors and I'm excited to start a new career. I mainly love building front-end UI/UX that inspires.</p>

			<p>The trend is a hero image, and anymore it seems to get cluttered.</p>
			<p>The glowing lightbulb effect sets off the picture and atmosphere very well.</p>
			<p>It grabs your eye. Eat and order. It's just right and has your call to action. A little CSS can do a lot.</p>
