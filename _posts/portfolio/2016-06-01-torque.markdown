description: A long time user of Torque Game Engine(non-shader), I really wanted to help on the code base when they updated to Torque3D(shaderized). As such, I tried to get the creators attention by creating demos using their new technology. My imagination was the limit and the artwork and modeling was so much fun.

			<h4>3D Modelling, Graphic Design, and Environment Conceptualization</h4>
			<hr/>
			<p>I learned a lot; like building a video game is insanely difficult. But, I found out that 3D modelling and graphic design can be very gratifying.</p> <!--more-->

			<h4>Demo 1: The Enchantment</h4>
			<hr/>
			<p>I have always wanted to make a 3D side scroller. I did all the art work except the guy running around and his sword.</p>

			<h4>Demo 2: Cave Demo</h4>
			<hr/>
			<p>Probably one of my favorites, just because if you could play the demo, you can hear the wind echoing behind you and it's sort of serene. I did all the artwork and sounds. The reflective water in the dark looks really nice. I turned the world upside down to create these mossy caves. Pushed the terrain system to a whole new level.</p>

			<h4>Demo 3: Side Scroller Shooter</h4>
			<hr/>
			<p>All artwork except the character. One of my favorite style games are Metroidvania. I tried to replicate Super Metroid(SNES).</p>

			<h4>Demo 4: Christmas Demo</h4>
			<hr/>
			<p>Procedural Shaders. Again I did all the art work except the guy rotating on the ice.</p>
