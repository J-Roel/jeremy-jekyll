		<p><strong>I really enjoy working in 3D, but changing over to web development and solidating my programming skills has really opened doors to learning new 2D art and mastering tools like after effects, spriter and many other frameworks. It so great having the ability to program cutting edge technologies, and then create the graphic designs and content for my projects.</strong></p>
