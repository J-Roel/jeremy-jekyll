#Code For Fort Collins

This repo is for our website, [codeforfoco.org](codeforfoco.org).

## Contributing Guidelines

We welcome new contributors. Not sure where to start? Check for any open [issues](https://github.com/CodeForFoco/codeforfoco.github.io/issues) or ping the team on our slack channel.

A few things to keep in mind:

- The `master` branch is production - develop on a separate branch.
- Ensure your code follows best practices and adheres to good style.

## Site Roadmap

- The current site is temporary and going to be replaced with an in-house Wintersmith based site.
